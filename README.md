# About The Game
The point of this game is to test reaction time. When you slide the switch, a sound will come from the board, or the neopixels on the border will light up. If a sound comes from the board, then you must press the right button as quickly as possible. If the board lights up with a color, then press the left button as soon as you can. The time you have to press the buttons will start to decrease the farther along that you get. If the timer runs out, or the wrong button is pressed, the board will flash red 3 times, then after a few seconds, your score will be shown.

# Scoring:
Points will be shown by the color and number of lights shown. 
## If you score 0-10 points, the lights will be white and the number of lit up lights will be your total points.
## If you score 11-20 points, the lights will be blue and your total points will be the number of lights lit up plus 10.
## If you score 21-30 points, the lights will be green and your total points will be the number of lights lit up plus 20.
## If you score 31 or more points, the lights will alternate between white and magenta. At this point, you have beaten the game, Congratulations!
